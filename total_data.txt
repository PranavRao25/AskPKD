Hostel Affairs
We, at IIT Palakkad, firmly believe that a good, nurturing environment leads to the better productivity of all the students concerned. Which is why, the Hostel Affairs Council, headed by the Hostel Affairs Secretary, is dedicated to make the environment of all the hostels conducive to better productivity and innovation.

Currently, we are located across two different campuses viz the Ahalia Campus and the Nila Campus, with three hostels spread across each campus, taking the total count to 6 hostels.

The hostels in the Nila campus are

                1. Bageshri

                2. Brindavani

                3. Tilang

The hostels in the Ahalia campus

Hostel 1
Hostel 2
Hostel 3
Hostel 4
Hostel 5
Each of the above hostels has a representative to better present the problems faced by the students of the particular hostel regarding the hostel and the mess to the Hostel Council, hence making it easier for students to report their problems as well. In order to make the system more fluidic, there is also a temporary campus representative in the Ahalia campus, who overlooks all the issues that may be faced by the students and helps the Hostel Affairs Secretary to understand them better.
 

The mess in both the campuses is currently operated by Sakthi’s Kitchen Pvt Ltd. The issues regarding the mess are regularly deliberated upon every month in the presence of the associated representatives of the mess and student mess representatives as well. Also, there is an Amenity Centre in the Nila campus and a canteen in Ahalia Campus to cater to the day to day needs of the students as well as faculty.

If there are any complaints/suggestions regarding the mess, kindly fill out this form.

Post Graduate Affairs

The PG section has grown a lot with the institute currently offering MS, M.Tech, M.Sc, and PhD degrees, with some M.Sc. and M.Tech courses beginning only the previous year. Being more experienced, PG students also become fundamental in the process of creating a more hands-on culture in the institute and some often offer guidance by assisting some professors in their undergrad courses. Even so, most of the PG students are usually working in labs and are always approachable and offer guidance to any undergrad who is interested in further studies.

Secretary, Post Graduate (SPG) Affairs is unique in itself as the secretary represents the welfare of the whole of the PG student community in all regards: academic, cultural, technical, sports and hostel too, except for research, which is dedicatedly handled by the Secretary, Research Affairs. SPG gives important advice and feedback from the PG students and hence plays an integral, indispensable role in the proper functioning of SAC. 

The institute, in collaboration with the SGP and SRA, organizes seminars, talks, institute colloquium, etc which form an essential part of the day-to-day activities for PG scholars. Research Scholar’s Day, like in other esteemed institutes, is also celebrated at IIT Palakkad, under the management of SGP. The secretary also works closely with the Associate Dean (Academics, PG) and Dean (Students) to provide better guidance and infrastructure to the post-graduates. The mail id for the Associate Dean (Academics, PG) is as follows :

Research Affairs

With our institute ever-evolving, we have seen tremendous growth in the quantity and quality of research that takes place.

The post is currently being held by the former PG Affairs Secretary, Ms Aiswarya Pradeepkumar, who is currently pursuing her PhD in Philosophy. And as the name of the post goes, the secretary will cater to all the needs and problems faced by the research students and bring it up to the institute’s attention alongside offering possible solutions to the problems as may have been suggested by the research community.

10.00 PM to 6.00 AM, the level of noise from the action of a resident should be 
sufficiently low that the activities of the IIT Community are not disturbed. Noise 
levels during the rest of the time should also not be a nuisance to fellow

 of 
  rooms 
 
 and 
 
 alterations
 
  
Rooms once allotted to the students are for an academic year. Requests for a change
of room are not entertained normally. Under exceptional circumstances a resident
may be reassigned a room, in the best interest of all  residents. In exigencies, the
hostel  administration,  without  assigning  any  reason,  may  shift  inmates
from one room to another.
The students are not permitted to change the locks (of the rooms) provided to them by
the Hostel management at the time of their occupation of the rooms. In case a change
of lock becomes necessary due to some reasons, a request must be made to the Hostel
management.
The residents are not allowed to move any furniture from its pre-allocated place.
Decoration  of  the  room  like  curtaining  the  window  is  encouraged.  However,
painting/scribblings on the walls, doors and windowpanes are not allowed. When the
resident moves out, the room must be returned to the state in which it was allotted to
the residents.
9. Maintenance 
 
 and 
 
 upkeep
 
  
Maintenance of hostel property is the collective responsibility of the residents of 
the hostel. If a room is damaged or its furnishings are damaged/lost, the residents 
are financially responsible. Deliberate destruction of hostel property will attract 
penalty ranging from fine to expulsion from hostel, and may also be referred to the 
Institute Disciplinary Committee. 
All residents should be conscious of the environment and should not litter 
indiscriminately. They should use the trashcans to dispose of waste. Wastes should be 
disposed in the particular dustbins kept for collecting the specific type of waste. Say 
food waste should be in green dustbin, other bio degradable waste in yellow dustbin and
non degradable waste in red dustbin.
The  hostel  rooms  should  be  kept  neat and  clean by the  residents.  Surprise
inspection of the rooms may be carried out. A penalty may be imposed in case the
room is found to be unclean.
Any complaints related to plumbing, electrical fittings, wifi etc may be raised on the 
support portal (https://support.iitpkd.ac.in).
10. 
 
 Residents’ 
 
  
Property
 
  
The residents are responsible for the safekeeping of their personal belongings. They
are advised to keep under lock all valuable items such as, Jewellery, Laptops, 
Mobile phone, etc. They should lock their rooms when not present, even for a short 
time. Hostel office cannot assume responsibility for the loss/damage of residents' 
property.
11.
   
        
 
 Stay 
 
  
during semester 
 
 break
 
  
Course students (BTech/ Msc) are supposed to vacate the rooms on the first day of
the summer / winter vacation, transfer their packed belongings to the room allotted for
that purpose, hand over the keys to the hostel office, and mark their date & time of
departure from the hostel. Failure to do so will attract a penalty. Students who need to
stay back for genuine reasons will be permitted only on getting written permission
from the concerned faculty supervisor and Dean (Students) in advance.
12.
  Collection 
 
 of 
  dues
 
  
In each semester, the dues to the hostel (including fines) should be cleared before
handing over the keys of the hostel room.
13. General hostel rules
Visiting the boys’ wings by girls and vice versa is strictly prohibited. Visit must be
restricted only at the common rooms of the hostels in Sahyadri campus or at the
entrance of hostels at Nila. If any boys or girls host the opposite ones will face strict
disciplinary actions including termination from the hostel and/or institute.
The common rooms must be used with dignity. 
B. OFFENSES
 
  
14.
   
 Ragging
 
  
Ragging is  a cognizable offense (offense for which the police  can arrest  the
offender without warrant). Our motto is: Zero Tolerance to Ragging! A firm NO to
ragging in any form!! If found guilty of ragging, action will be taken as per the law
of the land and the punishment may include expulsion from the institute. All hostellers
should be familiar with the Institute’s Anti-ragging rules.
15.
   
 Antisocial 
 
 Activities
 
  
Residents should not arrange any function or meeting within the hostel or outside
o r  w i t h i n  t h e  i n s t i t u t e  c a m p u s  w i t h o u t  s p e c i f i c  p e r m i s s i o n
o f  the Warden/Concerned Authorities. Residents should not indulge in antisocial,
anti national or any other undesirable activities within or outside the hostel zone.
Such activities attract severe penalties.
16.
   
 Use of 
 
 intoxicants
 
  
Smoking, consumption of alcohol and use of narcotics or any other intoxicant is strictly
prohibited. Entering the hostel premises in an intoxicated / inebriated state as well as
possession of alcoholic beverages and narcotics is also disallowed. Any violation of these
conditions  will  attract a  severe penalty including expulsion from the Hostel. In case of
possession of narcotics, the matter will also be referred to the local police.
17.
  Use of 
 
 Appliances
 
  
The power handling capacities of the electrical systems in hostels are limited. Therefore, 
overloading may result in tripping of the main power supply. Overloading can also lead to 
fire accidents. Usage of Iron press, Heaters with exposed heating coils, Immersion 
heating rods, Induction stoves and similar appliances are prohibited inside the hostel 
room. Use of hot-water kettles for heating water alone is permitted only at specific 
plug- points identified for the same, in the ground floor at the security point near the 
entrance of the hostel. The users need to ensure that the facility is kept clean after 
use. Use of desk lamps, computers and small audio systems are permitted, provided 
the combined power requirement does not exceed the electrical socket specification. 
Noncompliance with this rule will attract seizure of the disallowed equipment and a 
hefty fine.
18.
  Tampering
 
  
Any  tampering with the network devices and other electronic devices installed in the hostel
premises, or any disruption in the campus internet due to interfering with the network settings
would be considered very seriously and would invite disciplinary action.
19.
   Use 
 
 of 
  powered 
 
 vehicles
 
  
Use of powered vehicles (two-wheelers and cars) by hostellers, inside the campus is 
prohibited. Powered vehicles brought to the hostels will be confiscated. An exemption 
to this rule may be made for students with disabilities, on taking special permission 
from the Dean-Students.
Residents are encouraged to use bicycles. Bicycles should be parked only in
the space provided for cycle parking in an orderly fashion, both at the academic   
 buildings and hostel premises.
20.
   
 Accessing the Fire exit doors
 
  
   Fire exit/emergency doors are meant for use only during an emergency conditions 
   like fire accidents. Usage of such door in other than emergency period is considered  
   as a breach in hostel rules and strict action along with fine will be imposed on the
   defaulter.
21. Behaviour with Hostel Staff
Students are supposed to behave properly with the hostel staff and treat them with 
respect. Whenever any instruction is given by the Hostel Staff/Institute authorities the 
same should be followed and not challenged. Strict action will be taken against the 
misbehaving students, including suspension/termination from the hostel.
22.
  Rights 
 
 of 
  Hostel 
 
 Management
 
  
Any breach of the rules mentioned above will invite an enquiry that will be 
conducted by the Hostel Management. If a resident is found guilty, then the Hostel 
management will take disciplinary action that it deems fit. Depending on the case, the 
management reserves the right to take direct disciplinary action, including expulsion 
from the hostel with notice. Hostel authorities have the right to visit and inspect any 
hostel room at any time without prior intimation.
The Hostel Management reserves its right to change these rules from time to time 
keeping the students informed through general email.
For any further clarifications you may contact the hostel office in person during 
Office Hours or mail to hostelmanager@iitpkd.ac.in.

experts enable the students to develop a perspective of the subject, society, and its 
purpose. 
Teaching and Research happen in a synergistic manner in the department. The M. Sc 
Chemistry curriculum is the first of its kind as it augments fresh thinking among 
students by offering the subject in a holistic way under the broad themes of 
Structure, Energetics and Dynamics instead of compartmentalizing into physical, 
organic, and inorganic. You will find more about this under Programmes and Courses. 
It is never all work and no play. Our students have great fun at work and take lead in 
not only academic projects but also a number of social, and outreach events to 
engage with the public and school students. Please visit our Events page to know 
more.

Department of Data Science 
 The field of Data Science (DS) has grown from a bunch of "fancy" techniques that 
could "also" be applied into a set of well-founded methods to solve hard problems in 
various fields such as engineering and technology, science, and economics. This 
ubiquitous applicability of Data Science/ Artificial Intelligence (DS/AI) to a wide array 
of problems is a direct consequence of its generality, which in turn, has been fuelled 
by the complementary interaction between theory and application. 
Theoretical foundations of DS lie in machine learning algorithms, optimization, 
decision theory, and statistical learning theory. This foundational base ensures the 
guaranteed performance of DS/AI techniques while they are scaled across various 
problem domains.  As DS methods are applied to newer application domains, each 
application domain throws new challenges to theorists. Thus several aspects of DS/AI 
which are of current interest to theorists such as (not limited to) privacy, security, 
sample efficiency, transfer learning, domain adaptation, fairness, and interpretability 
are primarily rooted in various application domains. With the increasing complexity 
and computing needs of the data-heavy models and approaches novel innovations in 
systems are also very important. This gives the foundational knowledge in 
implementing the solutions efficiently. 
To sum up, the successful practice of DS entails proficiency in theory, 
implementation, and application domains. Given the potential impact of DS/AI in 
solving hard problems there is a ‘DS/AI’ push across the world. In order to be able to 
make an impact, it is important to make inroads in theory as well as applications. This 
high interdisciplinary work brings expertise from several domains into this 
department of Data Science and Engineering at IIT Palakkad. The department hosts 
research and education activities around AI and DS at IIT PKD. We are going to reach 
far beyond the common notion of developing AI-based tools and solving DS-related 
problems or rather conducting educational programs. We look forward to bringing 
the developments closer to society and nature. For more details click
